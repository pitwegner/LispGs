# LispGs

This implementation is an approach to be able to write Lisp code in a Smalltalk object database using the GemStone environment concept (first used in Ruby Maglev). Here, I use environment No. 3.

# Installation

* requires working GemStone setup on Version >= 3.5.0
* run `./setup.sh <stoneName>`

# Usage
